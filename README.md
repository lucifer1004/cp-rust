# About this repo

`cp-rust` means competitive programming in rust.

Source files to be committed are stored in `src/bin` so as to leverage rust's handy `autobins`.

`src/main.rs` is used as a command line tool to create/execute/commit programs easily. `cargo run` is used like `npm run`, you should be familiar with the latter, if you have experience in JS/TS development.
